# Bomblab
Basic bomblab project. Requires reading and understanding of assembly to provide program with specifically formatted strings to progress through defusal phases to defuse the bomb.

## Important Files:
- bomb - Compiled program. Running this in command line with the argument "answer.txt" passes the first five phases of the bomb.
- bomb.c - Contains incomplete program with purposefully hidden function calls, requiring the observation of assembly code to completely understand.
- answer.txt - Contains answers to the first five phases of the bomb.
